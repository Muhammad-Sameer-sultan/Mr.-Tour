            <h2>Chairman's Message</h2>
            <div class=" d-flex align-items-center align-items-sm-stretch justify-content-center flex-column-reverse  flex-sm-row  gap-5">
                <div>
                    <p>After working for Lufthansa Airlines in Frankfurt, Nairobi and New York for six years, I moved to
                        Los Angeles and opened Travel Store Inc. in 1975. We began as a boutique agency with a handful
                        of employees writing paper airline tickets. Today weâ€™ve transitioned to issuing e-tickets â€” one
                        of the many advancements our industry has seen in the last 40+ years.</p>

                    <p>Our first office was located near UCLA in Westwood Village, California, because I thought
                        professors planning sabbaticals would make for great clientele. With a developing reputation in
                        the travel industry, the company grew and I opened a second office in 1980, followed by more
                        branches across the Golden State.</p>

                    <p>As Chairman and [former] CEO of TravelStore, my goal has always been to make sure our company is
                        operating with the most sophisticated technology, while ensuring we continue to deliver a
                        personalized level of service to each of our clients.</p>

                    <p>
                        In 2005, I made the decision to create an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), allowing our
                        employees to benefit from being part owners in TravelStore.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Though my initial hope that professors would be our best clients didnâ€™t exactly prove to be
                        true, TravelStore has become much bigger and more successful than I ever imagined.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have always been guided by values like humility, integrity and respect in how we work with
                        each other and we have strived to treat others the way we wish to be treated. This is the
                        philosophy that has brought us much success. As we look to the future, it gives me great
                        confidence and pride to know that no matter how much the world may change, you can rely on
                        TravelStore to act in accordance with these values.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My sincere thanks to all of our professional agents and staff, the preferred suppliers we work
                        with, and to our respected clients without whom our success would not be possible.
